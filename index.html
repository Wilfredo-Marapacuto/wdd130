        <p> My name is Wilfredo Marapacuto, I am from Barquisimeto, Venezuela🇻🇪. I live in Utah with my family,
            my beautiful Wife and my two beautiful daughters. In my country i studied a Bachelor Degree in
            Physiotherapy.
            Although I am not currently practicing my profession in the US, I've studied and obtained a license as an
            Immigration
            Consultant in the state of Utah, an IRS Tax Preparer, and a Life and Health Insurance Agent. This has helped
            me start a
            business in Provo. My goal is to earn a bachelor's degree in software development, attend law school, and
            become a
            lawyer.</p>
